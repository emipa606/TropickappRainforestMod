  <!--<CK_PlantBromeliad.description>Commonly known as the Flaming torch, it is a species of bromeliad that is native to old Earth Brazil, Venezuela, French Guiana, Antilles and Cuba. They are adaptable, growing well as a terrestrial or epiphytic plant. When on the ground, they quickly create large clumps, and when planted at the base of a tree, they slowly will climb the trunk. The flowers on an individual plant last less than one month, but nearly all of the plants will come into bloom at the same time in the late summer.</CK_PlantBromeliad.description>-->

  <!--<CK_PlantHeliconia.description>Heliconias are sometimes called "lobster claws" or "parrot flowers" because of their beak-like "bracts".The leaves of this plant are paddle-shaped, and they are related to the banana family. The heliconia's flowers are tiny and found inside these bracts, which are so large and colorful that they almost hide the flowers altogether. Heliconias are found throughout the Neotropics and are actually quite common in the rainforest.</CK_PlantHeliconia.description>-->

  <!--<CK_PlantTreePalm.description>Palms are among the best known and most extensively cultivated plant families. They have been important to humans throughout much of history. Many common products and foods are derived from palms. In contemporary times, palms are also widely used in landscaping, making them one of the most economically important plants. In many historical cultures, because of their importance as food, palms were symbols for such ideas as victory, peace, and fertility.</CK_PlantTreePalm.description>-->
  <!--<CK_PlantTreeWildCoconutPalm.label>coconut palm tree</CK_PlantTreeWildCoconutPalm.label>-->
  <!--<CK_PlantTreeWildCoconutPalm.description>The coconut tree is a member of the palm tree family and the only living species of the genus Cocos. The term "coconut" can refer to the whole coconut palm, the seed, or the fruit. The term is derived from the 16th-century Portuguese and Spanish word coco meaning "head" or "skull" after the three indentations on the coconut shell that resemble facial features.

    Coconuts are known for their versatility of uses, ranging from food to cosmetics. The inner flesh of the mature seed forms a regular part of the diets of many people in the tropics and subtropics. Coconuts are distinct from other fruits because their endosperm contains a large quantity of clear liquid, called "coconut milk" in the literature, and when immature, may be harvested for their potable "coconut water", also called "coconut juice".

    Mature, ripe coconuts can be used as edible seeds, or processed for oil and plant milk from the flesh, charcoal from the hard shell, and coir from the fibrous husk. Dried coconut flesh is called copra, and the oil and milk derived from it are commonly used in cooking as well as in soaps and cosmetics. The hard shells, fibrous husks and long pinnate leaves can be used as material to make a variety of products for furnishing and decorating. The coconut also has cultural and religious significance in certain societies, particularly in India, where it is used in Hindu rituals.</CK_PlantTreeWildCoconutPalm.description>-->

  <!--<CK_PlantTreeWildBanana.label>banana</CK_PlantTreeWildBanana.label>-->
  <!--<CK_PlantTreeWildBanana.description>The banana plant is the largest herbaceous flowering plant. All the above-ground parts of a banana plant grow from a structure usually called a "corm". Plants are normally tall and fairly sturdy, and are often mistaken for trees, but what appears to be a trunk is actually a "false stem" or pseudostem. Bananas grow in a wide variety of soils, as long as the soil is at least 60 cm deep, has good drainage and is not compacted. Cultivated banana plants vary in height depending on the variety and growing conditions. Most are around 5 m (16 ft) tall, with a range from around 3 m (10 ft) to 7 m (23 ft) or more. Leaves are spirally arranged and they are easily torn by the wind, resulting in the familiar frond look.

      When a banana plant is mature, the corm stops producing new leaves and begins to form a flower spike or inflorescence. The banana fruits develop from the banana heart, in a large hanging cluster, made up of tiers (called "hands"). Individual banana fruits (commonly known as a banana or "finger") average 125 grams (0.276 lb), of which approximately 75% is water and 25% dry matter. In cultivated varieties, the seeds are diminished nearly to non-existence; their remnants are tiny black specks in the interior of the fruit.

      Bananas are naturally slightly radioactive, more so than most other fruits, because of their potassium content and the small amounts of the isotope potassium-40 found in naturally occurring potassium. The banana equivalent dose of radiation is sometimes used in nuclear communication to compare radiation levels and exposures.</CK_PlantTreeWildBanana.description>-->
