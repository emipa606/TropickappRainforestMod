Removed the need for ModCheck and Harmony by using vanilla-patching.	
Initial loading of a new map may take a while due to the large amount of plants that need to spawn.

# Some tips for surviving the rain forest:


   - Clear out plants for pathing. The dense jungle will considerably slow down pawns.
   - Wood is abundant, but trees take a long time to chop down. Prioritize time and resources and focus on smaller trees and plants when clearing large areas.
   - Foraging is a viable food option. Look out for rice, bananas, coconuts and lemongrass.
   - While rare, jitter berries, smokeleaf, psycoid, healroot and cotton can also be foraged.
   - The rain forest provides a lot of cover. Clear out areas to hit enemies, or use the cover to your advantage.
   - Some animals in the rain forest do a lot of damage and are very fast. Choose fights wisely and try to avoid being ambushed.
   - The rain forest rains a lot, so consider this when deciding on power and building options.
   - Remove rafflesias from your area as these drastically reduce beauty.
   - You can stop plant movement sway in the vanilla options menu.
